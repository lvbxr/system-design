air traffic control system is a classic example of mediator design pattern. 
1) Define an interface for mediator. 
2) Define another interface for client. 
3) Define concrete impl for the mediator interface 
4) Define concrete impl for the flight interface. 
Each flight object needs to register with the mediator.
